-Dimentio managed to survive by embedding his spirit within the Dark Prognosticus, but it took years to regain his strength
-By chance, Castle Bleck eventually crumbled and the Dark Prognosticus ended up in Subcon, where Wart found it
-When Wart touched the book, it allowed Dimentio to enter and manipulate Wart's mind, which gave him access to a new prophecy
-This new prophecy said that Dimentio would recruit the help of Wart, Sly Guy, Kamek to seek the Origin Star and resurrect him
-Dimentio was able to manipulate Wart and Sly Guy into serving him, and had them search for Kamek
-Wart and Sly Guy managed to enter the Mushroom World and find Bowser's Castle, but were captured by Bowser
-Bowser created an alliance with Wart and Sly Guy after learning that they shared a common enemy, but they were truly interested in Kamek
-They managed to convince an initially reluctant Kamek to betray Bowser and join them, promising him ultimate power
-Kamek soon learned of Dimentio and became the leader of the group
-Dimentio's plan was to have Kamek, Wart, and Sly Guy do the following
	-Steal the Grand Stars from Rosalina
	-Capture (or lure) the Star Children
	-Bring both of them to Subcon Castle, where they could be used to summon the Origin Star
	-Use the Origin Star to resurrect Dimentio
	-Join his new army and help him take over the dimensions

-After Bowser fight
	-This enrages Kamek, who attacks Bowser, slamming him into the wall and leaving him unable to move
	-Kamek then orders the heroes to come with him or the same fate will await them, a demand that they refuse
	-As the heroes and Kamek prepare for battle, Bowser gets up and charges at Kamek, sending him flying
	-The heroes take the opportunity to escape with the princesses, while Bowser and Kamek continue their fight
	-Bowser rushes towards Kamek to deliver another blow, but Kamek teleports behind him and this time incapacitates Bowser
