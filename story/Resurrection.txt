Kamek: And that is why we came here. To awaken the man sealed inside this book.
Mario: Who?
Kamek: *laughs* Oh, you know him well, Mario. After all, it was you who defeated him.
*Sudden realization dawns on Mario, Luigi, Peach and Bowser*
Peach: You can't be...
Kamek: It's too late, Princess. Soon he'll be released, and then you'll have no chance of stopping us.
Mario: Did he promise you power? He's lying to you. He'll get rid of you once his plans are finished.
Wart: Pah! What do you know?
Peach: We know him.
Yoshi: What are you guys talking about? Who is this man?
Kamek: Silence, all of you! There are only seven of you that we need for this. The rest of you will back away.
Bowser: Hey, I don't take orders from anyone, especially not you, you old fool!
Kamek: You don't control me any more, your Grouchiness. I'm the one giving the orders now.
Bowser: Raargh! I'll tear that smug grin right off your stupid face!
*Bowser charges towards Kamek in a rage. Kamek shoots a blast of magic from his wand, effortlessly disabling Bowser*
Bowser: Urgh, how did I lose to you?
Kamek: Let that be a lesson to you, heroes. Your attempts at resistance will not be tolerated.
Luigi: What do you mean, "there are seven of us that you want"?
Kamek: The seven Star Children. Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Peach, Donkey Kong, Wario. And Bowser.
Donkey Kong: What do you need us for?
Kamek: You'll see in a second. Now I said, the rest of you, back up.
*Toad, Daisy, and Rosalina do as they're told*
Kamek: Wart, do you have them ready?
Wart: Indeed I do. I sent Sly Guy to retrieve them before we came here.
Kamek: Good. Now I want the seven of you to arrange yourselves in a circle.
Wario: Can I be in the center of the circle?
*Kamek shoots a blast right at Wario, who jumps up in fright*
Kamek: That was a warning shot. Next time, you may not be so lucky.
*All of the heroes reluctantly do what Kamek says, arranging themselves in a circle*
Wart: Should I bring them out?
Kamek: Yes, it's time.
*Wart releases the seven Grand Stars, all of the heroes jump in surprise, especially Rosalina*
Rosalina: The Grand Stars...they were in the Observatory...
Sly Guy: Your ship sunk to the bottom of the ocean, and Kamek was able to retrieve them.
Rosalina: What are you planning to do with the Grand Stars and the Star Children?
Kamek: I suppose I'll tell you, since there's no chance of stopping it either way. You of all people should know who the Star Children are.
Rosalina: Seven people from the Mushroom World, gifted with the power of the stars.
Kamek: Quite right. But I doubt you know that there is a connection between the Star Children and the Grand Stars you guarded for so long. That connection
       generates an immense amount of power, enough to release what we're after.
Rosalina: The Origin Star. It's inside this castle.
Kamek: Right again. And it's time for us to summon it.
*Kamek begins chanting a spell*
Kamek: Out of the darkness, came a light
       Created out of Shy Guy's might
       Ancient power contained within
       I order your return begin!
*The Grand Stars and Star Children start to glow with light, as a bright light appears in the middle of the room. It starts to take shape, appearing close
 to a large Grand Star. The grand begins to shake, and the tremors throw the heroes back. Kamek begins to laugh uncontrollably.*
Kamek: Hahaha! The Origin Star is now ours!
Wart: Is it time? Time to release him?
Kamek: Oh, yes.
*Kamek takes the Dark Prognosticus and sets it down underneath the Origin Star. He uses his wand to open it up to the middle.*
Mario: Kamek, please! Don't do this!
Kamek: It's over! The seal on the book has been broken! He's already returning!
*Dark energy is starting to flow from the book into the air, creating a huge, purple-ish cloud. Chilling, sadistic laughter can be heard in the background.
 It's a sound that Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Bowser know too well.*
Bowser: Oh no. He's not summoning that clown, is he?
Peach: That laughter. It can't be anyone else.
*The clouds of dark energy start to take shape, forming into the basic outline of a person. The head morphs into a pointy hat, and the lower body begins to
 develop into curled shoes and a poncho. An outstretched, blue-looking hand sticks out and snaps its fingers. The shining light is whisked away, revealing
 the most deadly adversary that the heroes have every faced: Dimentio*
