Dimentio
-------------------------------------------------
-Born 4000 years ago as Merloo (4000 years prior)
-Founded the Tribe of Ancients
	-Advanced civilization founded on the pursuit of knowledge
	-Led by the Four Sages (Merloo, Merlumina, Merlimbis, and Merlight)
	-Built a magnificent empire that reached across the worlds
	-Highly advanced in science and magic
-One day, Merloo found a mysterious book in the Ancient Forest
	-Upon touching it, Merloo felt a powerful surge of energy travel up his body
	-He encountered frightening dark visions of the future
	-The book told him a single world: "Destiny"
	-Merloo realized that it was dark magic, and was about to leave, but something made him take the book with him
-He brought it back to the Tribe of Ancients and took a look at it
	-Merloo tried to ignore the book, but he felt a strange sensation, as if the book were calling out to him
	-He wrote down: "Nobody who has possessed this book has ever found happiness"
	-Merloo was surprised at how he had just written that, but continued to write more
-Merloo continued writing in the book, the darkness growing within him
	-He received dark visions of the future from the book, which he wrote down
	-The book foretold that the kingdoms of the worlds would fight over that very book, and full into ruin
	-A dark object called the Chaos Heart would be born from the marriage of a pure princess and monster king
	-Some person known as the "dark one" would use the Chaos Heart's power to destroy all worlds
	-Four heroes would rise to stop the "dark one": a man in red, the pure princess, the monster king, and a man in green
	-The man in green would also wield the Chaos Heart to destroy all worlds
	-In the end, the heroes would fail and all worlds would be destroyed
-As Merloo continued to write in the book, the darkness started to change him
	-His skin began to change from human to dark blue
	-Merloo realized that it was his destiny to carry out the prophecy foretold in the book, as the "dark one"
	-He adopted the persona of Dimentio: an evil jester who was a master of dimensions
-Under the persona of Dimentio, Merloo set the prophecy in motion by giving the book to a civillian in the Tribe of Ancients
-Over the course of 2000 years, the book, which came to be known as the Dark Prognosticus, changed hands
	-Kingdoms fought wars over the book
	-Even ordinary people lusted after it, hoping to learn their own future
	-But everyone who acquired the Dark Prognosticus encountered nothing but ruin
-As the Dark Prognosticus went from person to person, Dimentio began plotting the downfall of the Tribe of Ancients (3000 years prior)
-He adopted another persona of Marloo, a magician who had learned great power
-Dimentio created the Pixls by transferring a spirit into a vessel that he had created for a specific purpose
	-The first Pixl was created from the spirit of his daughter, who had fallen ill and been killed by Dimentio for that purpose
	-She became known as the Pixl Queen
	-After creating the Pixl Queen, Dimentio created 12 more Pixls
-The magician's apprentices learned how to make many more Pixls based on his original 12
-They became known as "thinking tools" for the Ancients, who eventually grew dependent on the Pixls
-After creating the Pixl Queen from his daughter, Dimentio engulfed his entire house in flame, making it look like an accident
	-His wife, whom Dimentio no longer cared for, was killed
	-Dimentio only chose to rescue his son, Ganter
-Being grateful to Dimentio for saving his life, Ganter was incredibly loyal to Dimentio
-Dimentio taught Ganter dark magic, and eventually allowed Ganter to know of his evil plan and assist him with it
-Once the Ancients had become dependent on the Pixls, Dimentio ordered the Pixl Queen to attack the Tribe of Ancients and recover the Dark Prognosticus
	-The Pixl Queen used her powers to mind control the other Pixls to rebel against their masters
	-Devastated by the loss of the Pixls they had become so dependent on, the Ancients were easily enslaved
	-Only the 12 original Pixls were immune to the Pixl Queen's control
-In the midst of the ruin, the inheritors of the twelve original Pixls rebelled against the Pixls
	-The leader of the group was killed and replaced by Ganter, who did so under Dimentio's orders
	-They defeated wave after wave of Pixl soldiers and freed the enslaved Ancients
	-Used Catch Cards to trap the mind-controlled Pixl soldiers and then healed them
-The last survivor, Ganter, managed to make it to the Pixl Queen's castle
	-The Pixl Queen used her powers of illusion to hide and bombard him with horrific images
	-Fortunately, the Pixl at Ganter's side had the ability to see the truth, and together they fought and defeated the Pixl Queen at the cost of the Pixl's life
	-Ganter recovered the Dark Prognosticus from the Pixl Queen and left her dying body behind
-Ganter returned to Dimentio, where they began planning to create a new tribe
	-They would create a new tribe known as the Tribe of Darkness
	-The Tribe of Darkness would live hidden away to keep the Dark Prognosticus until it was time to release the Chaos Heart
	-Ganter would be the leader of the Tribe of Darkness, secretly carrying out Dimentio’s orders
	-Once their plan had succeeded, the Tribe of Darkness would rule a perfect world with Dimentio as its leader
-Dimentio told him to gather members of the Tribe of Ancients who would be willing to join the Tribe of Darkness
	-Ganter went throughout the Tribe of Ancients and told people that the Pixl Queen had been created with knowledge from the Dark Prognosticus
	-He told them about his plan to keep the book hidden in order to prevent another similar disaster from occurring
-Dimentio then founded the Tribe of Darkness
	-Lived in the Castle of Darkness, the Pixl Queen's old castle
	-Created Flopside and sealed away the Pixl Queen’s spirit in the Flopside Pit of 100 Trials
	-Ganter ruled the Tribe of Darkness as its king
	-The people of the Tribe of Darkness had dark magic given to them by the Dark Prognosticus, but it also changed them like it did to Dimentio
-Ganter chose a wife and had a son, who he named Blumiere
	-He lied to Blumiere about how the humans in the Tribe of Ancients were despicable
	-Ganter did this in order to make sure that the bloodline of the Tribe of Darkness wasn’t mixed, as only pure Tribe of Darkness blood could support the Dark Prognosticus
-After the Pixl Uprising, the Tribe of Ancients became fearful of the Pixls
	-The Ancient Elders outlawed the creation of new Pixls
	-With the Pixl Uprsing leaving them weakened and the Tribe of Darkness splitting off, the Tribe of Ancients began to decline
-As time went on, Blumiere started to become more emotional and rebellious
	-Ganter reported this news to Dimentio, and remarked that he could be a problem for their plan
	-Dimentio agreed with Blumiere, saying that if Blumiere rebelled against them, they could lose the bloodline of the Tribe of Darkness, which would threaten the creation of the Chaos Heart
	-Ganter said that he would try to talk some sense into Blumiere
	-Dimentio agreed and told Ganter to talk to him again if the problems continue
-Ganter attempted to talk to Blumiere, but the talk turned into an argument which ended with Blumiere storming out
-Blumiere left the Castle of Darkness to take a walk in the Ancient Forest, when suddenly, the ground crumbled underneath him and sent Blumiere plummeting off a cliff
-A woman from the Tribe of Ancients named Timpani saved him, and they began to fall in love with each other
-Dimentio eventually discovered this and reported it to Ganter, who warned Timpani to stay away from the Tribe of Darkness
-When Timpani told Blumiere, they decided to get married
-Out of anger, Blumiere’s father cursed Timpani to wander across the dimensions
-Blumiere turned to the Dark Prognosticus, becoming Count Bleck and murdering the entire Tribe of Darkness
-Count Bleck searched for Timpani for many long years, but finally concluded she was dead
-He then decided to end all worlds with the Chaos Heart
-Count Bleck found several minions
	-Nastasia, a bat that he saved and was turned into a woman
	-Mimi, a Pixl experiment
	-O’Chunks, a burly general
-With the Tribe of Darkness destroyed, Dimentio was left to continue his plans on his own (1500 years prior)
	-However, Dimentio could the situation to his advantage
		-Blumiere had been driven insane by the loss of Timpani
		-In his insanity, Count Bleck was willing carry out the prophecies of the Dark Prognosticus
		-He would destroy all worlds, and then Dimentio would take the Chaos Heart from him and use it to create his own perfect world
	-Dimentio first needed a way for Count Bleck to be defeated
		-He decided to manipulate the Tribe of Ancients into helping him defeat Count Bleck
		-The Ancient Elders became aware of Count Bleck's plan and sought a way to protect the world from him
			-Merlimbis created the Purity Heart to counteract the Chaos Heart, and split it into the eight Pure Hearts in order to protect them from evil
			-Merloo and Merlumina wrote the Light Prognosticus, a counterpart to the Dark Prognosticus which foretold that the heroes would save the worlds and told them how to do so
			-The Ancients then traveled the worlds, finding people to protect the Pure Hearts until the heroes arrived
			-Merlight created dimensional doors in Flipside that would lead the heroes to the Pure Hearts
		-Survivors of the Tribe of Darkness agreed to work together with the Tribe of Ancients to save the worlds
	-Dimentio then approached Count Bleck and asked to join him, hoping to manipulate his plans
		-Count Bleck declined him at first, but after reading about Dimentio in the Dark Prognosticus, he allowed Dimentio to join him
		-Dimentio intended to help the heroes defeat Count Bleck, then take the Chaos Heart from him to use himself
-As time passed, the Tribe of Ancients eventually dissolved into ruin, leaving behind nothing but the city of Flipside, where descendants of the Ancients lived
-Meanwhile, Timpani had actually survived her curse (500 years prior)
	-She ended up in Flipside, where Merlon found her
	-Timpani was close to death, so Merlon used magic from his ancestors to transfer her spirit into a Pixl named Tippi
	-However, Tippi didn’t remember anything about her past life, so Merlon was unable to tell who she was
	-Tippi lived in Flipside for a while, becoming friends with Merlon
	-Merlon had received the Light Prognosticus from his ancestors, and they worked together to find the heroes of legend and stop Count Bleck
