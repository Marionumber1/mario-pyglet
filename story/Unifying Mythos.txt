-Mushroom World history
	-Tribe of Ancients spread its influence across other dimensions, including the Mushroom World
	-Indigenous Mushroom World inhabitants were Goombas, which the Ancient humans interbred with, creating Toad race
	-Over time, the Toads came to assert their dominance over Goombas, driving many of them to the neighboring Koopa Kingdom
	-The human Ancients mostly died out with the decline of their tribe, but there were some survivors scattered across the world
		-Peach and Daisy's families became nobility, leading kingdoms (the Mushroom Kingdom and Sarasaland)
		-Others, like Mario and Luigi's parents, lived in more remote areas of the world (such as Yoshi's Island)
		-Some families, like Wario and Waluigi's, were destitue and unscrupulous people
-Subcon's history
	-Mushroom World and Subcon were originally the same, with Subcon's inhabitants living in the world
	-However, the Mushroom Kingdom and Sarasaland were controlled by the Ancients, while Subcon's people had alliances with the Tribe of Darkness
	-During the war between the two tribes, the Mushroom Kingdom/Sarasaland fought the Shy Guys, with the Koopa Troop not really involved
	-Eventually, their dimensional warfare caused the world to catastrophically split into two, the Mushroom World and Subcon
	-Subcon became a strange land of dreams, while the rest of the Mushroom World stayed mostly intact
	-However, remanants of the Mushroom World remained in Subcon as Subspace, which included mushrooms and coins
-The Origin Star
	-Somehow, the Shy Guys in Subcon acquired a powerful artifact known as the Origin Star
	-They wanted to hide its power, so they took energy from it to create the seven Grand Stars and imbued seven Mushroom World babies with its power
	-These seven Grand Stars and seven Star Children were linked to each other, so that only they together could summon the Origin Star's full power
	-Ancient Tablets were written to tell of this ritual requiring the Grand Stars and Star Children, and hidden in the Subcon Desert
	-The Grand Stars were given to a human guardian in the Mushroom World, who would also serve as protector of the cosmos (Rosalina's family)
	-By chance, four of the Star Children became the heroes of legend foretold by the Dark Prognosticus
-Wart's role
	-Ganter made an alliance with the Shy Guy leadership during his war with the Ancients to get involved with their war
	-However, many of the general public did not support getting involved in the conflict, and wanted to leave it
	-After the dimensions split and the Shy Guys were sealed away in Subcon, the Shy Guys began an uprising against their leaders and overthrew them
	-This resulted in a new, better government being established, but the old Shy Guy leaders were left desperate for revenge
	-Meanwhile, an evil king named Wart was building an army to take over the world, and happily accepted the old leaders
	-Most of the leaders, however, gained a low status as foot soldiers, with the exception of Sly Guy, who became Wart's right-hand man
	-Over time, the Shy Guys in Wart's army forgot about their old lives and resigned themselves to Wart's service
	-After Wart became powerful enough, he attempted to take over Subcon, but was stopped by the heroes
