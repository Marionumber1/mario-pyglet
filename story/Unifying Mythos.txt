	-The Shy Guys recognize it as dark magic, and attempt to stay away from it, with the leaders vowing to keep the book safe and hidden
	-However, many of the leaders are tempted by the book's power and eventually read it, becoming taken in by its power like Merloo was
	-Some of the uncorrupted leaders reveal this to the public, and they attempt to stop their leaders, causing a civil war
	-Due to the technological prowess of both sides and the Origin Star, the war is incredibly destructive and both sides are ruined by the fighting

	-A war breaks out between the two Tribes, with the Ancients attempting to retrieve the Prognosticus
	-Neither side gains much of an advantage for most of the war, but Dimentio is concerned about the Ancients' greater numbers of soldiers

	-Many Goombas, who dislike the humans, welcome the Shy Guys and fight with them, while the humans and Toads fight back
	-Most of the humans in the world are killed by the Shy Guys' attack, and many Toads are too, due to their association with the Ancients
