-Creation of the multiverse
	-Before the multiverse existed, there was only the Void
	-The Void's dark energy eventually condensed into matter and created the dimensions
	-The Underwhere/Overthere was the first world created
	-Subcon (possibly including the Mushroom World) was formed soon after
-Subcon's birth
	-A large amount of dimensional energy came together to form the Origin Star
	-The Origin Star came to reside in Subcon, its energy speeding up the world's formation
	-It accelerated the evolution of life on Subcon, and eventually gave rise to the Shy Guys
	-The Origin Star, which was sentient, shielded itself inside a castle in the sky, which later becomes Subcon Castle
-Shy Guy civilization grows
	-A civilization of Shy Guys formed, who felt a great power in the sky and worshipped it as a god
	-The Shy Guys' proximity to the Origin Star causes them to develop magical prowess and expands their knowledge of the universe
	-Their civilization grew more advanced, eventually reaching a technological level far beyond 21st century Earth
	-Having mastered magic, science, and technology, the Shy Guys reached out into other worlds and guarded the Origin Star closely
-The Tribe of Ancients forms and masters magic
	-In a dimension called Lineland, many groups of humans lived together in villages
	-Demons from the Underwhere managed to open a rift into Lineland, leaking powerful magical energy into the dimension
	-Several people, including Merloo, were exposed to this energy and managed to master it, gaining knowledge of elemental magic
	-The Four Sages (Merloo, Merlumina, Merlimbis, Merlight) founded the Tribe of Ancients, an advanced civilization based on the pursuit of knowledge
	-Through years of study, the Ancients made advances in science, and came to understand the laws of nature at a high level
	-Merloo, one of the most intelligent in the tribe, used magic with physical laws to manipulate the universe, inventing dimensional magic
	-The secrets of dimensional magic are taught to many members of the tribe, and "flipping" becomes commonplace
-Dimentio's awakening and the Age of the Prognosticus
	-A demon from the Underwhere creates an empty book of dark magic, designed to lure a powerful magician, and sends it through the rift
	-Merloo, the most powerful magician of the Ancients, is drawn to the Ancient Forest and discovers the book
	-He senses its dark magic and tries to leave, but the book manipulates him and forces him to take it back to the Ancients
	-Merloo is controlled by the book's dark power and writes out the Dark Prognosticus, learning of his destiny as the Dark One
	-His new goal is to bring the Ancients into power by destroying or subsuming opposing nations, as the Prognosticus predicts
	-Taking on a new identity as Dimentio, he lets the Prognosticus into the hands of a member of the Ancients, beginning the Age of the Prognosticus
	-People and civilizations fight over the book, bringing chaos to the Ancients and all of Lineland
	-The Four Sages start to realize that people are drawn to the Prognosticus because they crave knowledge, without caring about morality
	-They figure out that pursuing knowledge without a heart leads to evil, and reform the Tribe of Ancients to be based on love
-The Dark Prognosticus comes to Subcon
	-The Dark Prognosticus manages to cross dimensional borders, passing through many and eventually reaching Subcon
	-The Shy Guys recognize it as dark magic, and attempt to stay away from it, with the leaders vowing to keep the book safe and hidden
	-However, many of the leaders are tempted by the book's power and eventually read it, becoming taken in by its power like Merloo was
	-Some of the uncorrupted leaders reveal this to the public, and they attempt to stop their leaders, causing a civil war
	-Due to the technological prowess of both sides, the war is incredibly destructive and both sides are ruined by the fighting
	-The Tribe of Ancients also enters to reclaim the Prognosticus and stop the destruction, taking advantage of the civil war
	-In the end, the Shy Guys lose many of their advancements and regress heavily, the Ancients taking back the book
	-While the old leaders of the Shy Guys are executed for their crimes, all Shy Guys come to hate the Ancients for their interference
